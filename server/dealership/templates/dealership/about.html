        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Founded in 2023, Car Dealership Reviews was born out of a frustrating car-buying experience. Our founder realized that there was no centralized platform for consumers to share their dealership experiences, making it difficult for others to know which dealerships provided excellent service and which ones to avoid.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">What started as a simple idea has grown into a comprehensive platform that helps thousands of consumers make informed decisions about where to purchase their next vehicle.</p>
